# Core Ledger

Hello! ðŸ¤ 

# What?

This project aims to work towards offering a **_bare minimum_** ledger.

It exists purely to work through some concurrency control ideas.

The single main idea is guaranteeing a total order for a given grouping key.

To do this, we

* Load balance requests to ensure all are handled on the same instance
* Ensure all requests of a single group are performed sequentially

# The API

See inside [CoreLedger](./CoreLedger)

# Load Balancing

Earlier in this readme, we addressed the desire to be able to guarantee to send all requests of a specific identifier to
the same server. We will do this using a load balancer. For the sake of this project, that is nginx.

To start our server now, using docker compose,

```shell
docker compose up --scale api=2
```

This brings up our api, with two duplicate instances. We load balance between the two instances, based on the hash of
the grouping id header. This is done using nginx and the network configured in
the [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file.

```shell
curl --location '0.0.0.0:4000' --silent | jq
```

Will now return you something like the below. Note the hostname is actually the docker host, so we can verify we are
hitting different containers.

```json
{
  "Hello": "World",
  "Host": "9dbdfff785c7"
}
```

## Libraries

We make use of a couple of libraries within here, namely

* [Npgsql](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql) for postgres connections and data
* [suave.io](https://suave.io) for an F# flavoured web server
* [suave testing](https://github.com/SuaveIO/suave) For testing suave
* [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org) For database migrations
